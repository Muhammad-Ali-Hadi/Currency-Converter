1. User selects the **source** and **target** currencies.
2. User enters the amount to convert.
3. On clicking the "Convert" button:

     ```
     https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@{date}/v1/currencies/{from}.json
     ```
   - The exchange rate is extracted using:
     ```js
     rate = data[from][to];
     ```
   - Result is displayed in the format:
     ```
     1 USD = 278.15 PKR
     ```
